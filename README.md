Hi there! 👋

So, I've finally made the decision to take programming seriously. Therefore, I've decided to do this LeetCode 30-day JavaScript (JS) interview challenge. 😃

I'll make sure to update this Readme file with the link to each daily challenge in this repo on GitHub and on the LeetCode website. Please wish me well! 🌟😊❤️
